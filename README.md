#Windows Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for Android
===========

The ADAL SDK for Android gives you the ability to add Windows Azure Active Directory authentication and authorization to your application with just a few lines of additional code. Using our ADAL SDKs you can quickly and easily extend your existing application to all the employees that use Windows Azure AD and Active Directory on-premises using Active Directory Federation Services, including Office365 customers. This SDK gives your application the full functionality of Windows Azure AD, including industry standard protocol support for OAuth2, Web API integration with user level consent, and two factor authentication support. Best of all, itâ€™s FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) so that you can participate in the development process as we build these libraries. 

## ADAL for Android 1.0 Released!

Thanks to all your great feedback over the preview period, we have released 1.0 (GA) of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Library for Android! 

## Features
* Industry standard Oauth2 protocol support.
* IdToken exposure for full access to the token contents.
* Multi resource refresh token allows for apps registered together to access different APIs without prompting the user.
* Cache with Encryption for easily accessing existing tokens and session state with assurance it wasn't tampered with.
* Support for the Microsoft Azure AD Authenticator plug-in for Android, which will be released soon!


## Contributing

All code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and we triage actively on GitHub. We enthusiastically welcome contributions and feedback. You can clone the repo and start contributing now. if you want to setup a maven enviroment please [check this](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/wiki/Setting-up-maven-environment-for-Android)

## Getting Started
We've made it easy for you to have multiple options to use this library in your Android project:

* You can use the source code to import this library into Eclipse and link to your application. 
* If using Android Studio, you can use *aar* package format and reference the binaries.

##Download
###Option 1: Source Zip

To download a copy of the source code, click "Download ZIP" on the right side of the page or click [here](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/archive/master.zip).

###Option 2: Source via Git

To get the source code of the SDK via git just type:

    git clone https://github.com/MSOpenTech/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android.git
    cd ./azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/src

###Option 3: Binaries via Gradle

You can get the binaries from Maven central repo. AAR package can be included as follows in your project at AndroidStudio:

```gradle 
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
    maven {
        url "YourLocalMavenRepoPath\\.m2\\repository"
    }
}
dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile ('com.microsoft.aad:adal:1.0.0')
}
```

###Option 4: aar via Maven

If you are using the m2e plugin in Eclipse, you can specify the dependency in your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.aad</groupId>
    <artifactId>adal</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

To build with Maven, you can use the pom.xml at top level

  * Follow the steps at [Prerequests section to setup your maven for android](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/wiki/Setting-up-maven-environment-for-Android)
  * Setup emulator with SDK 18
  * go to root folder
  * mvn clean install
  * cd samples\hello
  * mvn android:deploy android:run
  * You should see app launching
  * Enter test user credentials to try

Jar packages will be also submitted beside the aar package.

###Option 5: jar package inside libs folder
You can get the jar file from maven the repo and drop into the *libs* folder in your project. You need to copy the required resources to your project as well since the jar packages don't include them.

## Prerequisites

* Maven 3.1.1+
* Git
* Android SDK
* AVD image running (API level 14) or higher.
* Android SDK with *ALL* packages installed
* You may use any IDE that supports Maven. Eclipse ADT will work fine after you complete prereq step.

## How To use this library

1. Follow the Prerequisites

2. Add a reference to your project and specify it as an Android library. If you are uncertain how to do this, click here for more information: http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html

3. Add the project dependency for debugging in to your project settings

4. Update your project's AndroidManifest.xml file to include:

    ```Java
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
      <application
            android:allowBackup="true"
            android:debuggable="true"
            android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:theme="@style/AppTheme" >
            
            <activity
                android:name="com.microsoft.adal.AuthenticationActivity"
                android:label="@string/title_login_hello_app" >
            </activity>
      ....
      <application/>
    ```

5. Register your WEBAPI service app at Azure Active Directory(AAD), https://manage.windowsazure.com 
  * NOTE: You need to write down the APP ID URI for the next steps
 
6. Register your client native app at AAD

Select webapis in the list and give permission to previously registered(Step5) WebAPI 

  * NOTE: You will need to write down the clientId and redirectUri parameters for the next steps.
 

7. Create an instance of AuthenticationContext at your main Activity. 

The details of this call are beyond the scope of this README, but you can get a good start by looking at the sample projects. Below is an example:
 
    ```Java
      // Authority is in the form of https://login.windows.net/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
      mContext = new AuthenticationContext(MainActivity.this, authority, true); // This will use SharedPreferences as            default cache
    ```
  * NOTE: mContext is a field in your activity
  
8. Copy this code block to handle the end of AuthenticationActivity after user enters credentials and receives authorization code:

    ```Java
     @Override
     protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
         super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
         if (mContext != null) {
             mContext.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
         }
     }
    ```

9. To ask for a token, you define a callback

    ```Java
    private AuthenticationCallback<AuthenticationResult> callback = new AuthenticationCallback<AuthenticationResult>() {
    
            @Override
            public void onError(Exception exc) {
                if (exc instanceof AuthenticationException) {
                    textViewStatus.setText("Cancelled");
                    Log.d(TAG, "Cancelled");
                } else {
                    textViewStatus.setText("Authentication error:" + exc.getMessage());
                    Log.d(TAG, "Authentication error:" + exc.getMessage());
                }
            }
    
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(AuthenticationResult result) {
                mResult = result;
    
                if (result == null || result.getAccessToken() == null
                        || result.getAccessToken().isEmpty()) {
                    textViewStatus.setText("Token is empty");
                    Log.d(TAG, "Token is empty");
                } else {
                    // request is successful
                    Log.d(TAG, "Status:" + result.getStatus() + " Expired:"
                            + result.getExpiresOn().toString());
                    textViewStatus.setText(PASSED);
                }
            }
        };
    ```
10. Finally, ask for a token using that callback:

    ```Java
     mContext.acquireToken(MainActivity.this, resource, clientId, redirect, user_loginhint, PromptBehavior.Auto, "",
                    callback);
    ```
    
    Explination of the parameters:
    
  * Resource is required and is the resource you are trying to access.
  * Clientid is required and comes from the AzureAD Portal.
  * You can setup redirectUri as your packagename. It is not required to be provided for the acquireToken call.
  * PromptBehavior helps to ask for credentials to skip cache and cookie. 
  * Callback will be called after authorization code is exchanged for a token. 
  
  The Callback will have an object of AuthenticationResult which has accesstoken, date expired, and idtoken info. 

Optional:  **acquireTokenSilent**

You can call **acquireTokenSilent** to handle caching, and token refresh. It provides sync version as well.
 
    ```Java
     mContext.acquireTokenSilent(resource, clientid, userId, callback );
    ```

Using this walkthrough, you should have what you need to successfully integrate with Azure Active Directory. For more examples of this working, viist the AzureADSamples/ repository on GitHub.
       
## Important Information

### Customization

Library project resources can be overwritten by your application resources. This happens when your app is building. For this reason, you can customize Authentication Activity layout the way you want. You need to make sure to keep the id of the controls that ADAL uses(Webview).

### Authority Url and ADFS

ADFS is not recognized as production STS, so you need to turn of instance discovery and pass false at AuthenticationContext constructor.

Authority url needs STS instance and tenant name: https://login.windows.net/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com

### Querying cache items

ADAL provides Default cache in SharedPrefrecens with some simple cache query fucntions. You can get the current cache from AuthenticationContext with:
```Java
 ITokenCacheStore cache = mContext.getCache();
```
You can also provide your cache implementation, if you want to customize it.
```Java
mContext = new AuthenticationContext(MainActivity.this, authority, true, yourCache);
```

### PromptBehavior

ADAL provides option to specifiy prompt behavior. PromptBehavior.Auto will pop up UI if refresh token is invalid and user credentials are required. PromptBehavior.Always will skip the cache usage and always show UI.

### Silent token request from cache and refresh

This method does not use UI pop up and not require an activity. It will return token from cache if available. If token is expired, it will try to refresh it. If refresh token is expired or failed, it will return AuthenticationException.

```Java
Future<AuthenticationResult> result = mContext.acquireTokenSilent(resource, clientid, userId, callback );
```
You can also make sync call with this method. You can set null to callback or use acquireTokenSilentSync.

### Logger

ADAL provides simple callback logger. You can set your callback for logging.

```Java
Logger.getInstance().setExternalLogger(new ILogger() {
    @Override
    public void Log(String tag, String message, String additionalMessage, LogLevel level, ADALError errorCode) {
    ...
    }
}
// you can manage min log level as well
Logger.getInstance().setLogLevel(Logger.LogLevel.Verbose);
```


### Encryption

ADAL encrypts the tokens and store in SharedPreferences by default. You can look at the StorageHelper class to see the details. Android introduced AndroidKeyStore for 4.3(API18) secure storage of private keys. ADAL uses that for API18 and above. If you want to use ADAL for lower SDK versions, you need to provide secret key at AuthenticationSettings.INSTANCE.setSecretKey

### Oauth2 Bearer challange

AuthenticationParameters class provides functionality to get the authorization_uri from Oauth2 bearer challange.

### Session cookies in Webview

Android webview does not clear session cookies after app is closed. You can handle this with sample code below:
```java
CookieSyncManager.createInstance(getApplicationContext());
CookieManager cookieManager = CookieManager.getInstance();
cookieManager.removeSessionCookie();
CookieSyncManager.getInstance().sync();
```
More about cookies: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieSyncManager.html
